# Myanswers
## Business purpose
Our product myanswers.io will be a web-based, simple and easy-to-use, highly-searchable, multilingual, multi-tenant knowledge base (KB) that will answer customersâ€™ questions, without them having to email the customer service department. It can also be used to centrally access and manage organizational knowledge of employees. This product will be initially used within our own organisation. Once fully tested, it will be rolled out to our existing customers, and finally to new customers.
The end product is a commercial Software-as-a-Service product to be sold in Europe and the U.S. It will need to be integrated with an hosted search engine, an authentication service, a subscription management product, email notifications management software, an external mail provider and a payment gateway. It will also have eventually its own API, so customers can integrate our product with their applications.
